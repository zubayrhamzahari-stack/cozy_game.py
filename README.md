# Cozy Corner (prototype)

This is a tiny cozy-game prototype built with Pygame.

Features

- Move a character with arrow keys or WASD.
- Sit/stand with Space — sitting near the fire increases your Cozy score.
- Collect tea to gain more cozy points.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python "C:\Users\zubay\OneDrive\Desktop\Hello world\game.py"
```

Notes

- This is a minimal example with no external assets. It should run with a standard Python + Pygame setup.
- If running inside a headless environment (no display), run locally on your machine with a desktop session.
